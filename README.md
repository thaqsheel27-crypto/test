# OBLIQ GitHub Pages

This folder contains static HTML pages generated from your uploads.

## Files
- `index.html` — Home
- `projects.html` — Projects
- `sustainability.html` — Sustainability
- `about.html` — About
- `contact.html` — Contact
- `assets/site.css` — Minimal shared styles

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new **public** repository (e.g., `obliq-site`).
2. Upload all files and folders from this zip to the repo root.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` / `/ (root)`
4. Wait for the green Pages build check. Your site will be live at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

Tip: Your landing page is `index.html`. Links between pages already point to the correct filenames.
